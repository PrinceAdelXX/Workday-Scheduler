# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Objective

The Workday-Scheduler app allows the user to plan their work day based on a 9AM-5PM schedule. Users are obliged to enter their daily tasks and are reassured that their entries have been stored in local storage. Any further changes made to the scheduler will be saved if the user decides to do so.
